Introduction
==============

Computer environment setup script for Ubuntu and other platform.

Nameing of the repo
--------------------

Hojo (from The Ten Foot Square Hut. 方丈), or The Ten Foot Square Hut.

That's almost exactly the size of the original author's (@130s) current office at his home. Also common with Hojoki is that from this tiny space, knowledge is compiled and distributed to the world (for me roboticis squad (exagge*)).

Run Python's tests
====================

Python modules in this package can be tested via `nosetests <http://nose.readthedocs.io/en/latest/>`_.

Currently you should move to %REPO_HOME%/`test` folder to run nosetests.
